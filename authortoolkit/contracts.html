<p>We have already mentioned the importance of a good collaborative relationship between you, the author (plus your agent) and your publisher (us!), to establish a successful book publishing. To avoid misunderstandings and lack of clarity a strong and fair publishing contract is vital.</p> 

<p>A contract consists of several clauses, and although your editor or a representative from the rights department will discuss each section of the contract with you, we have added information on some of the most important clauses below, followed by a “contract checklist”.</p>

<h4><b>The Work</b></h4>
<p>This section includes the formal description of your work such as the agreed delivery date of your manuscript, as well as the maximum length, use of images and the number permitted. House style guidelines are also described here so that you can implement them from the outset.</p>

<h4><b>Advance and Royalties</b></h4>
<p>These are the two ways you as an author usually get paid. The advance is a sum of money paid when you sign the contract with us. Royalty rates are the percentage of the book’s sale price which is paid to you for each book sold. The payments differ based on how many copies we believe will sell. If you have hired a literary agent, they require a percentage of your advance and royalties.</p>

<h4><b>Subsidiary Rights</b></h4>
<p>Contains the rights to produce or publish a product in different formats than from your original manuscript. There are several types of subrights; quotation, hardback and paperback reprint, large print, braille, translation, US rights, electronic (eBook or app), audio rights, film/TV rights, stage rights, merchandise rights – to mention a few.</p>

<h4><b>Warranties and Indemnities</b></h4>
<p>A warranty is a binding assurance by the author to the publisher that your work is true and fit for use. This can include a guarantee that it is not plagiarised and that your work contains nothing defamatory in nature. Indemnity means accepting financial responsibility on behalf of the publisher such as costs through lost sales.</p>

<h4><b>Checklist for a good publishing contract</b></h4>
