<h4><b>What is copyright?</b></h4>
<p>Copyright is the legal framework which protects an artist’s ownership of their IP (their work), and ensures that no one can copy or profit from it without the author’s permission.</p>

<h4><b>How long does copyright last?</b></h4>
<p>For most works in the UK it lasts ‘life plus 70’: until 70 years after the end of the year of an author’s death. After that the work becomes Public Domain where everyone is free to use it without any special permission needed.</p>

<h4><b>Are there any variations to the duration of copyright?</b></h4>
<p>Yes, these include the following:</p>
<ol class="list-style" type="1">
  <li><b>Works by non-European authors:</b> every country has its own approach to copyright law. If the country of the author has a shorter period of copyright protection, the same period will apply to those works when exploited in the UK.</li>
  <li><b>Works not made available to the public during the author’s lifetime:</b> unpublished works of an author who died before 1st August 1989, will remain in copyright until 50 years from when they were first posthumously made available to the public.</li>
  <li><b>The publisher’s copyright:</b> the publisher automatically owns the layout and typographical arrangement of a published work. This copyright lasts until 25 years after the edition was first published, before then the work cannot be photocopied or reproduced without the publisher’s permission.</li>
  <li><b>Translations:</b> copyright in the translation belongs to the translator.</li>
  <li><b>Letters:</b> normally the letter itself belongs to the recipient, but the copyright in its content belongs to the writer.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Can you quote a copyrighted work without permission?</b></h4>
<p>There are limited circumstances where you can, but usually you always need permission to quote from works in copyright. This includes quotations of any length from poems, letters, lyrics and recipes, as well as artwork, images, photographs, maps and line drawings. Exceptions include quotations (if the use is fair dealing and genuinely for the purpose of quotation), caricature, parody and pastiche and educational purposes.</p> 

<h4><b>Are there any other rights related to an author’s work apart from copyright?</b></h4>
<p>Yes, an author also has legally recognised Moral Rights:</p>
<ol class="list-style" type="1">
  <li><i>The right to Paternity</i>: an author’s right to be identified whenever a work is published, performed or broadcast.</li>
  <li><i>The right of Integrity</i>: an author’s right to object to disrespectful treatment of their work, honour or reputation.</li>
  <li><i>The right of False Attribution</i>: an author’s right to not be falsely attributed as an author</li>
  <li><i>The right of Privacy</i>: an author’s right to protect personal information from public scrutiny.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>What happens when a book’s rights are sold?</b></h4>
<p>It means another entity is given the right to use some of the rights the publisher has to a work. This can include selling rights for a book to be made into a TV show or a motion picture, or translation rights in order to distribute the book in other languages to international markets.</p>
