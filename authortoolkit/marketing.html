<p>The marketing of your book may very well begin up to a year before your book is published. Our marketing team is well equipped to create an effective marketing strategy for your book, and by using efficient outputs, connect your title to the audience which would appreciate it most. When we promote your book, we focus on the marketing mix, or the 4ps: <i>price, product, place</i> and <i>promotion</i>. These are significant areas to work with in order to establish how, where, and when your book will do best.</p> 

<p>This brings us to your book’s <i>unique selling point</i>: what is the key hook to convey to potential readers about your book that makes it stand out? The <i>cover design</i> and <i>book blurb</i> are here two very important factors we consider when communicating the chosen selling point. Among ALL the books out there it is important to have a cover which attracts consumers and makes them want to buy exactly <i>your</i> book, including a blurb that should be short and draw people in.</p>

<p>As you know by now, we plan a book’s publication a long time in advance. This allows us to choose the best timing to promote your book, especially in creating good <i>word of mouth</i>. Our marketing team pays special attention to this marketing concept and in understanding how content “spreads”. One key strategy is here to produce <i>advanced information sheets</i> in order to encourage early quotes for your book and raise people’s awareness of it.</p> 

<p>To further create anticipation around the publication of your title, we will organise book signings and tours to reach more readers, as well as developing your brand as an author. We are aware that books sell for a number of reasons. However, it is proven that the <i>author brand</i> along with <i>positive reviews</i> are a major decisive factor for people when they buy a book, which is why our author events are to be of the highest quality.</p>
