  <p>Let’s talk about the big, blue bird in the room – social media. The platforms now serve as efficient channels for communication and distribution in the publishing world, and is of importance not just for us but also for you, the author. Even though it is becoming an increasingly significant tool (especially in producing a strong word of mouth - marketers go as far as to call social media ‘WOM on steroids’ because of its strong connectedness), we still consider social media as <i>part</i> of our wider marketing strategy.</p>

  <p>No, you don’t need millions of followers to become a successful author, but every little advantage helps so a strong social media presence is encouraged. Remember, social media platforms are able to bring together likeminded people in a community and is as such a good way of addressing many people at once, as long as you know where and how to reach them. Here are some tips to follow as to best present yourself to the digital world:</p>

  <ol class="list-style" type="1">
    <li><b>Set yourself up well:</b> if you don’t already have one, create a profile on your preferred platform (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook). You don’t have to use them all, but consider which platforms best promotes you as the author you wish to be and which you are most comfortable with using. Also consider where to best reach your readership; YouTube, Twitter and book blogs attract a younger crowd, while Facebook is often used by parents. Your editor along with the marketing team, can here give you helpful advice on what platform would be ideal for promoting your title.</li>
    <li><b>The importance of being you:</b> get known for your positive enthusiasm, and view your audience as friends in order to put forth a more personal tone. At the same time remember that you are promoting yourself as an author, and what you post should be in coherence with your work. Social media is all about generating excitement around your book while at the same time giving potential readers the chance to get to know you.</li>
    <li><b>Engage your followers:</b> in getting your audience to become familiar with you, try to think of ways you can involve them in your posts. Can you ask them questions in order to start a conversation? Engagement is vital across any platform, so ask for advice, recommendations, what they do – come across as interested and they will be interested in you!</li>
    <li><b>Promote yourself as a brand:</b> if you are comfortable with your social media platforms you can start to think beyond the content and perhaps create a specific style to your posts. Will you focus on having images in all your posts, or include specific phrases? This will not only form coherence, it will also make it easier for followers to recognise your posts and as such give way for more loyalty and higher author brand awareness.</li>
